## Work experience

#### 2012	*Data Mining Intern*, @Tencent(QQ) Inc.

- **Unveiling the Unique Features of Tencent Weibo**

Used Hadoop to process collected data of more than 320M users and 3.7B microblogs on a cluster of 36 servers. Studied Tencent Weibo from both macro and micro levels, discovered interesting difference between Tencent Weibo and Twitter.

- **User-level Microblog Recommendation based on Semi-Supervised Algorithm**

Our group proposed a Factor Graph based microblog recommendation algorithm TSI-WR (Topic-Level Social Influence based Weibo Recommendation), outperformed several baseline methods. Responsible for data cleaning in the group.


## Academic experience

#### 2014	*Research assistant*, @CS, Columbia U

- **Extracting the Social Network of the Taliban (ongoing)**

Using natural language processing technique to perform social event extraction over a large tranche of newspapers and magazines produced by Taliban, aim to construct a mapping of the social network of the Taliban leadership.
#### 2013	*Bachelor thesis*, @EE, THU

- **Greedy Forwarding for Mobile Social Networks Embedded in Hyperbolic Spaces**

Designed and evaluated a novel greedy message forwarding algorithm using metrics in hyperbolic spaces, obtained competitive performance in terms of message delivery ratio and cost. Poster presented in SIGCOMM'13.
